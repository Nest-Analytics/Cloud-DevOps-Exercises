# Exercise Briefs

This repository contains the weekly exercise briefs for the Cloud/DevOps training.

Students do not need to clone this repository to use it. Each week can be opened and read directly on GitHub.

## How this repo is organised

Each week has its own folder:

- `week-01/`
- `week-02/`
- ...
- `week-12/`

Inside each week folder you will typically find:

- `README.md`  
  The main exercise brief: scenario, tasks, deliverables, and what to submit.
- `acceptance-criteria.md`  
  The marking checklist: what must be present for a pass.
- `resources.md`  
  Optional links and reading.

---

## What students should do each week

1. Open the folder for the current week (example: `week-02/`).
2. Read `week-01/README.md` fully.
3. Complete the tasks.
4. Submit work in the **cloud-devops-submissions** repository:
   - Create or use your personal branch
   - Add your work under the correct week folder (example: `week-02/`)
   - Open a Pull Request into `main`

Submission instructions are explained in detail in the submissions repository.

## What to submit (general rule)

Each week will specify exact deliverables, but submissions commonly include:
- notes or write-up (Markdown)
- screenshots (PNG/JPG)
- scripts (PowerShell, Bash)
- code (when applicable)
- command output or logs

---

## Support and questions

When raising a question, include:
- week number (example: Week 2)
- step you are stuck on
- screenshot or exact error message
- what you already tried

---

## Trainer notes (internal)

Suggested weekly publishing routine:
- Update the week folder on `main`
- Keep instructions stable once the week starts
- If you must change something mid-week, add a short "Update" section at the top of that week README with the date and what changed
